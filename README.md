########################################################################################
Download the Folder 15112 Game.

Open and run 15112_game_code.py for the game.

########################################################################################
Python needs to have installed pygame. If not installed, please install with pip.

########################################################################################

This game only runs full-screen and it was tested on several windows laptops. 
However, it might not work as expected on some exceptions due to differences in systems 
(some windows laptops are not perfectly compatible with pygame's get_size functions for full screen. 
Eg: one of the laptops I own.)
It also might not work well if the laptop's screen size and resolution is very different from average.

This game has not been tested on macs due to a lack of macs at home.

and main menu background, as well as the music. Here are the citations.

15112 Update: This Repository was technically made a few minutes past the deadline.
That's because this Repository is a joined version of my original repositories 
for the game which were separated and annoying to download. The original was frozen 
within the deadline and shown to the CA. They are currently private and archived.

THANK YOU AND ENJOY
